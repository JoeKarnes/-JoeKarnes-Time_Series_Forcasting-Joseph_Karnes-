#Time_Series_Forcasting-Joseph_Karnes
The goal of this project was to use time series forcasting models to predict the cost of multiple products from a product demand history dataset (available here: https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting). The data cleaning included dropping null date values, adding back in the negative values that had been encased in parentheses, and eliminating the features that did not directly relate to product sales or the specific product identity. After graphing the first 20 products and getting a rough look at their trends, I chose four products to test. The models that I wanted to use were decomposition and gradient-boosting regression. Unfortunately, I had run out of time when doing analysis on the results of the decomposition tests, so I could only say a few things on the trends that had been obtained from this analysis. For the other method of gradient-boosting regression, I needed to convert the dates of the dataset to integers in order to properly analyze the data, so I set out attempting to convert the dates into raw day values by looking at the day differences between each entry. Unfortunately, I could not finish due to time constraints.
